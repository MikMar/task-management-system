1. Authentication and Authorization
```
POST /api/auth/register – Register a new user (create a new account).
POST /api/auth/login – Log in and return a JWT token.
POST /api/auth/logout – Log out (invalidate the token).
GET /api/auth/user – Get details of the currently logged-in user (protected route).
```
2. Users (if needed for task assignment)
If your tasks are assigned to specific users, you'll need user management endpoints:

```
GET /api/users – List all users (admin only).
GET /api/users/:id – Get a specific user’s details.
PATCH /api/users/:id – Update a user’s details.
DELETE /api/users/:id – Delete a user (admin only).
```
3. Tasks
This will be the main functionality for the task management system. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks are key.

```
POST /api/tasks – Create a new task.
GET /api/tasks – List all tasks (optional filters like assignedTo, status, etc.).
GET /api/tasks/:id – Get task details by ID.
PATCH /api/tasks/:id – Update task details (e.g., assign, change status).
DELETE /api/tasks/:id – Delete a task.
GET /api/tasks/statuses – Get the possible task statuses (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).
```
4. Project Management (optional)
If you want to group tasks by projects:

```
POST /api/projects – Create a new project.
GET /api/projects – List all projects.
GET /api/projects/:id – Get project details by ID.
PATCH /api/projects/:id – Update project details.
DELETE /api/projects/:id – Delete a project.
GET /api/projects/:id/tasks – List tasks related to a specific project.
```
5. Task Comments (optional)
Allow users to comment on tasks for collaboration.

```
POST /api/tasks/:id/comments – Add a comment to a task.
GET /api/tasks/:id/comments – Get all comments for a task.
DELETE /api/tasks/:id/comments/:commentId – Delete a comment on a task.
```
6. Notification Service (important for task updates)
Send notifications to users when tasks are assigned, updated, or completed.

```
GET /api/notifications – Get all notifications for the user.
POST /api/notifications – Create a notification (e.g., a new task assigned).
DELETE /api/notifications/:id – Delete a specific notification.
```
7. Health Check and Monitoring
Ensure that the system is running smoothly:

```
GET /api/health – Health check endpoint for the API.
GET /api/metrics – Optional, to expose system metrics for monitoring.
```
